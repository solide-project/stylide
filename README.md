## About Stylide

**Stylide** is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for **Stylus** smart contracts. It aims to provide developers with a powerful and user-friendly platform for writing, compiling, and deploying contracts within the Stylus blockchain ecosystem. Stylide supports seamless integration with Stylus networks, facilitating efficient contract management and testing. This repository serves as the home for Stylide, supporting developers in their journey of smart contract development and deployment on Stylus.
